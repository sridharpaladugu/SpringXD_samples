Pivotal offers HAWQ, SQL-on-Hadoop engine. HAWQ is designed as a MPP SQL processing engine optimized for analytics with full transaction support. HAWQ breaks complex queries into small tasks and distributes them to MPP query processing units for execution. The query planner, dynamic pipeline, leading edge interconnect, and the specific query executor optimization for distributed storage are designed to work seamlessly, to support highest level of performance and scalability. Based on Hadoopâ€™s distributed storage, HAWQ has no single point of failure and supports fully automatic online recovery. System states are continuously monitored, therefore if a segment fails; it is automatically removed from the cluster. During this process, the system continues serving customer queries, and the segments can be added back to the system when necessary.
